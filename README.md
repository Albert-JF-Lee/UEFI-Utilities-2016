# UEFI-Utilities-2016

Various UEFI utilities built against UDK2015

Create a subdirectory immediately under UDK2015 called MyApps, populate MyApps with one or more of the utilities, fix up MyApps.desc to build the utility or utilities.

Note these utilities have only been built and tested on an X64 platform.

See http://blog.fpmurphy.com for detailed information about a utility.

Enjoy!
